This code creates a simple Flutter app with two screens: a MenuScreen that displays a list of menu items as a list of MenuItems, and a MenuItem that displays information about each menu item as a list of tiles.

You can add other menu items, change styles, add images, etc. to customize the app for your pizzeria.
